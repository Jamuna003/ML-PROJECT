Adult Income Classification 
This project applies machine learning to the Adult Census Income dataset to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K annually based on demographic and work-related features.

Overview
Goal: Build a classification model to predict income categories (>50K or ≤50K).
Approach: Exploratory Data Analysis → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

Workflow
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized distributions, patterns, and correlations.
Data Preprocessing – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled features.
Model Training – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others.
Evaluation – Classification report with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Results
Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 84.92%
F1-score:84.91%
