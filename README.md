#  Adult Income Classification (ML Project)

This project applies machine learning to the **Adult Census Income dataset** to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K annually based on demographic and work-related features.  
## Overview
- **Goal**: Build a classification model to predict income categories (>50K or ≤50K).  
- **Approach**: Exploratory Data Analysis → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

##  Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized distributions, patterns, and correlations.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled features.  
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others.  
4. **Evaluation** – Classification report with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model**: *Random Forest Classifier* 
- **Accuracy**: 84.92%   
- **F1-score**:84.91%
