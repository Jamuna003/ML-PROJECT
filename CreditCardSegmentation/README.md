#  Credit Card Customers Segmentation

This project uses clustering techniques to segment credit card customers into distinct groups based on their spending and usage behavior. These insights can help financial institutions improve customer targeting, personalize offers, and enhance retention strategies.

---

## Overview
- **Goal**: Group customers into meaningful segments using unsupervised learning.  
- **Approach**: Exploratory Data Analysis → Data Preprocessing → Clustering → Segment Profiling.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  

---

##  Workflow
1. **EDA** – Distribution checks, outlier detection, correlation analysis.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Scaling features, handling missing values.  
3. **Clustering Methods** – K-Means (elbow method, silhouette score), PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
4. **Segment Profiling** – Interpreted cluster characteristics (e.g., high spenders, budget users).

##  Results
- Segment 1: High-value premium customers with high spending and frequent usage  
- Segment 2: Budget-conscious users with low spending and fewer transactions  
- Segment 3: Moderate spenders with balanced usage  
- Segment 4: Irregular users with unpredictable behavior
